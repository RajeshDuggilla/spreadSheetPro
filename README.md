## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript in strict mode
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **ESLint** for code quality and consistency

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser to the provided localhost URL

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular component architecture:

- **App.tsx** - Main application container managing global state
- **Components/**
  - **SpreadsheetGrid** - Main grid with cell rendering and interaction
  - **Cell** - Individual cell component with editing capabilities
  - **Toolbar** - Formatting and action buttons
  - **FormulaBar** - Cell value editing interface
  - **SheetTabs** - Tab management for multiple sheets
  - **MenuBar** - Application menu system
- **Types/** - TypeScript definitions for spreadsheet data structures
- **Utils/** - Helper functions for spreadsheet operations

## Features Implemented

✅ Pixel-perfect spreadsheet interface
✅ Cell selection and editing
✅ Keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Tab, Escape)
✅ Formula bar integration
✅ Multi-sheet support with tabs
✅ Professional toolbar with all standard actions
✅ Responsive grid layout
✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
✅ ESLint configuration
✅ Clean component architecture

## Design Decisions

- **Component Separation**: Each major UI element is a separate component for maintainability
- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing for better development experience and fewer runtime errors
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for consistent styling and rapid development
- **State Management**: Local React state with prop drilling - suitable for this prototype scope
- **Keyboard UX**: Full keyboard navigation support matching Excel/Google Sheets behavior
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern interface that feels production-ready

## Browser Support

Modern browsers supporting ES2020+ features. Tested on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Considerations

- Virtualization could be added for very large datasets (1000+ rows/columns)
- Cell rendering is optimized with React.memo for better performance
- Keyboard events are properly debounced and handled efficiently
